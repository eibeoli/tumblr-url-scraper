### About
Finding urls that athat you want can take time. Instead of individually typing each desired url into your blog settings on tumblr, using a python script to check multiple urls at once cuts that time down exponetionally.

Note: This script can't tell the difference between unavailable urls from deleted/banned blogs, and available urls that have not been used, so expect some false positives. Still a work in progress!
### Run
In the same path where you've downloaded the script, open the command line and run 

> python tumblr_scraper.py
